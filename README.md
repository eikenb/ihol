I Hate OutLook (ihol)
---------------------

We use Office-365 at work, but I despise the online Outlook 'client' for
calendaring. So I wrote this. Turns out several of my co-workers are in the
same boat, so I'm sharing this here.

At the moment it outputs calendar events in
[remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind/) or basic
[ICal](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar) formats for adding them to local
calendars. It will also output the full body of the next or more events.

I Hate OutLook (ihol)
---------------------

We use Office-365 at work, but I despise the online Outlook 'client' for
calendaring. So I wrote this. Turns out several of my co-workers are in the
same boat, so I'm sharing this here.

At the moment it only prints out calendar events in
[remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind/) format or outputs the
bodies. I will probably add [ICal](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar)
output as well, and maybe [calcurse](http://calcurse.org/) output (I'm thinking
about switching from remind to calcurse).
